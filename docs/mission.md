# Lerni - Mission

## Vision

**Help people learn deeply and remember permanently.**

Lerni combines two proven learning techniques:
1. **The Feynman Technique** - Learn by teaching; if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it
2. **Spaced Repetition** - Fight the forgetting curve with scientifically-timed reviews

## Core Beliefs

### Learning is Active
Passive consumption (reading, watching) creates an illusion of understanding. True learning requires active engagement: explaining, questioning, connecting.

### Simplicity Reveals Mastery
The ability to explain complex topics in simple terms is the ultimate test of understanding. Jargon often masks confusion.

### Forgetting is Natural
Without reinforcement, we forget ~80% of new information within days. Spaced repetition transforms short-term recall into permanent knowledge.

### Privacy Matters
Your notes may contain proprietary information, personal reflections, or half-formed ideas. Lerni runs locally with no network calls by default.

### AI Assists, Not Replaces
AI agents can challenge and grade your understanding, but the learning must come from you. AI is opt-in and serves as a coach, not a crutch.

## Target User

- Self-learners studying technical or complex topics
- Professionals maintaining expertise across domains
- Students who want active recall over passive review
- Anyone who has read a book and forgotten it a month later

## Success Metrics

A successful Lerni user:
- Can explain their studied topics to a beginner
- Maintains a consistent review habit
- Identifies and fills knowledge gaps over time
- Retains information months/years after initial study

## Non-Goals (MVP)

- Social features / sharing
- Cloud sync
- Mobile apps
- AI-generated content (AI challenges your content, doesn't create it)
